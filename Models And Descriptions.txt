Model 1 (Density Model) (Classification)
    Dataset - 
        This Dataset consists of all the images regardless of image view and abnormality type..... this will be a classification Dataset
        And will classify the images in density 1 2 3 4 .... This dataset will be made from full mammogram image

Model 2 (Segmentation/ Bound box model/ Crop Image)
    Dataset - 
        This dataset consists of all the images regardless of image view and abnormality type..... this will consist of full mammogram image
        with combined abnormalities masks. This model will give ouput as the marked lesions / abnormalities on the image.

Model 3 (Abnormality type model) (Binary)
    Dataset -
        This dataset consists of the cropped images of each lesion...... this will be a binary model and will tell if the abnormality is mass
        type or calc type.... this model will be trained on cropped images.

Model 4 (Mass Shape Model) (Classification)
    Dataset - 
        This dataset will contain cropped images of only mass abnormality type... and the dataset will be classified into all the mass shapes
        present in the data and will be passed into the model to train it for classifying the mass shape.

Model 5 (Mass Margin Model) (Classification)
    Dataset - 
        This dataset will contain cropped images of only mass abnormality type... and the dataset will be classified into all the mass margins
        present in the data and will be passed into the model to train it for classifying the mass margin.

Model 6 (calc Type Model) (Classification)
    Dataset - 
        This dataset will contain cropped images of only calc abnormality type... and the dataset will be classified into all the calc types
        present in the data and will be passed into the model to train it for classifying the calc types.

Model 7 (calc distribution Model) (Classification)
    Dataset - 
        This dataset will contain cropped images of only calc abnormality type... and the dataset will be classified into all the calc
        distribution present in the data and will be passed into the model to train it for classifying the calc distribution.
